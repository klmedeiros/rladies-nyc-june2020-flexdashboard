# flexdashboard for Prototyping and Profit

Slides + code from my June 2020 R-Ladies NYC virtual meetup talk on how to use flexdashboard for prototyping dashboards and distrupting the tree industry.

**In order to run the code in this repo, you'll need the NYC 2015 Tree Census Data. You can download it on the [NYC Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2015-Street-Tree-Census-Tree-Data/uvpi-gqnh) or on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nycparks/tree-census).**
